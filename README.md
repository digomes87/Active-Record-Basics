<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project, you’ll get to spend some quality time with models. The tutorial will give you a chance to apply some of what you’ve learned in a structured environment and then the additional project will give you the chance to do it on your own.

## Project 2: Micro-Reddit
Let’s build Reddit. Well, maybe a very junior version of it called micro-reddit. In this project, you’ll build the data structures necessary to support link submissions and commenting. We won’t build a front end for it because we don’t need to… you can use the Rails console to play around with models without the overhead of making HTTP requests and involving controllers or views.
